There are two ways to create a client

**Via Shnappy**

Login to the Shnappy admin panel, choose clients and press 'New client'. Enter the client's name and choose a password
to protect the gallery.

Shnappy will then create the folder in your Shnappy Dropbox directory, ready for you to add images.

**Via Dropbox**

Simply create a folder with your clients name in your Shnappy Dropbox directory. Shnappy will automatically create a
draft client. Set the password in the Shnappy admin panel and you're good to go.
