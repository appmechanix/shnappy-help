Remember to make sure that your client has finished with their gallery first!

* Open your Shnappy admin
* Find the client you wish to remove under Clients
* Hit the settings tab
* Scroll down - you will see a 'Delete client' button

Deleting a client does not remove the files from your Dropbox, only from Shnappy. This means that you still have access to the photos but your client no longer will.
