Shnappy allows you to create clients without passwords, letting anyone who has the URL view your images. Be careful doing
this with work that you wish to keep private.

Once you've logged into Shnappy, open the client that you wish to set to public and go to the Settings tab. Simply check
public gallery and boom, everyone can see your photos.

To require a password again, simply uncheck the same checkbox.
