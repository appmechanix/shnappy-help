Sometimes you only want a client gallery to be visible for a short time. Shnappy allows you to set an end date to any
client.


From within the client you want to expire, hit Settings in the sidebar and scroll down to the Expire Gallery checkbox.
You can select the date by clicking on the textbox that appears when you enable client expiry.
