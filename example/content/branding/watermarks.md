Shnappy can automatically watermark images that you upload, saving you time and making it easier to manage your images.

#### Getting started

* Login to Shnappy if you're not already
* Head into your Studio settings
* Choose Watermark on the side bar <img src="%image_url%/branding/watermarks/shot1.png">
* Choose Add watermark and upload your watermark PNG file

#### Why does Shnappy only support PNG files?

Shnappy currently only supports the PNG file type because it allows for transparency.

#### Turning off for selected clients

Login to the Shnappy admin, find the client and press settings. Turn off "Automatically watermark images"

#### I can't see my watermark

Only the client interface shows watermarks - the admin shows you your images as you uploaded them.
