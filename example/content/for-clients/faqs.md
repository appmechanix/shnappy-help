#### Why aren't bulk downloads instant?

Shnappy needs to download the high quality version of the images you have request and compress them into a ZIP files - this
can take a few minutes while the work is done.

Once we have processed your request, you will receive an email with a download link for your photos. At this point we also
discard any personal information gathered for the purposes of this job.

#### What is Shnappy?

Shnappy is a tool for use by photographers to manage and display secure client galleries. It also lets your photographer
and you communicate and share thoughts easily using the comment feature and favourites.

#### Your Personal Information

Your email address is used by your photographer to keep track of your comments and favourites, and to make contact with
you through their Shnappy account. You will only receive updates from Shnappy directly when your photographer replies
to your comments or adds photos. These messages can be stopped by clicking the link within the email.

We will never distribute your personal information or send out promotional material. We hate spam too.
