Welcome! Thanks for choosing Shnappy. There's really only three steps for getting started.

**What you'll need**

* A Dropbox account (their free account works perfectly with Shnappy)
* An internet connection
* Registering for Shnappy

Jump along to the [Shnappy homepage](https://shnappy.com) and choose 'Register' up in the top right hand corner. You'll then be redirected to
Dropbox to login.

Your Shnappy login uses your Dropbox username and password, saving you having to remember another login. This also saves
a step in the signup process by connecting your accounts automatically.

Login with Dropbox and allow Shnappy access to its own folder. Shnappy will not have access to any of your other Dropbox
folders, keeping your private stuff private.

You will then be redirected back to Shnappy to setup your studio and create your first client!
