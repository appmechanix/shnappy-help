Shnappy displays a cover image at the top of your gallery to draw the eye and begin to show off your awesome photos. You don't have to choose a cover image - Shnappy can do the hard work for you by assigning your first upload as the gallery cover.

How do I change my cover photo?

* Login to Shnappy if you're not already
* Find the client that you want to change the cover for
* Choose Cover Design on the sidebar
* Click the Choose button beside the cover image text box
* Choose the picture you'd like to use and press close
* Hit save

If you have any client galleries open they'll need to be refreshed to see the new cover.
