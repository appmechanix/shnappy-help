Albums are a great way to separate different aspects of a single photoshoot.

Albums are automatically created based on the folders in your Dropbox client directory. Photos in the root client directory are displayed in the Highlights album.

If you haven't created albums within a client directory, the album picker will be hidden on the gallery view.

Shnappy only supports one level of albums to keep the experience more simple for both you and your client.
